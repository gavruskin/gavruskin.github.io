## Molecular Data Science Lab

*We develop mathematics and computer science necessary to answer rigorous questions about molecular data.
Our ultimate goal is achieved when we observe how molecular biology and data science shape modern mathematics and computer science.*

The lab will be launched in February 2018 as a part of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.otago.ac.nz/) at [University of Otago](http://www.otago.ac.nz/), and we are planning to recruit a few new members later that year.
Job ads will be posted soon and the positions will remain open until filled (no deadline), but do fire me an email if you are interested in doing a PhD or postdoc in New Zealand's South Island.
We are happy to accommodate applicants' own scientific interests and I am happy to provide further details to interested people, especially those who have a clear reason to work with me.
The successful applicants will be working in close collaboration with [Genomics Aotearoa](http://www.otago.ac.nz/genetics/news/otago659624.html) in New Zealand and [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology](http://www.evolbio.mpg.de/2169/en) in Germany.

The lab will have it's own corner on the web but for now do watch this space and stay tuned by following me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gavruskin).
